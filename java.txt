//! Static variables
Static variable can call by directly with the help of class only,
 we do not need to create object for the class in this.


 //! Local variables
 The variables declared inside the body of the method are termed local variables
    
    public static return_type function_name(parameter 1, parameter 2, .....)
{
    // Body of function
    // or set of statements    
}

//! instance variables

The variables that are declared inside the class but outside the scope of any method are called instance variables in Java.
The instance variable is initialized at the time of the class loading or when an object of the class is created.
An instance variable can be declared using different access modifiers available in Java like default, private, public, and protected.
